      <p class="strongest">What do you look for when you're thinking about user accessibility?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          There are quite a few factors to consider when designing for user accessibility. Like many choices in website development, it's crucially important
          to consider who your target audience will be. What challenges will they come across while browsing the web? What parts of your website will struggle
          against certain needs? For this website, I do not have any particular people or disciplines in mind, but rather an understanding of common tools used
          for enhanced accessibility.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          For example, screen readers are very common for not only those that are unable to read traditionally sized print, but also people that don't have the
          time to go through an entire page of content. People such as recruiters or hiring managers may utilize tools to speed up the process of gathering
          information from this site while combining this output with things like language learning models to summarize key details. It is my job to ensure
          those tools can effectively comb through this website by utilizing the proper tags, descriptions, names, and syntax to tell these tools where that 
          content is located. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <p class="strongest">Why are you not using optimization for img alt tags?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          When I was researching best practices while developing this website, I came across a relatively disturbing discipline. In order to give you a proper
          reason as to why I don't utilize it, let me tell you about why it exists. When you use a search engine to navigate to a website, it gathers key points 
          of data to rank results based on how likely they match your query. After all, if a search engine doesn't take you where you want to go, what is the 
          point in the first place?
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Well, some of the data that can be used by certain search engines include metadata for images used in websites. It's relatively clever engineering, 
          to be honest. If a user is trying to search for pet care, a site full of puppy pictures is far more likely to have the information they need than
          one full of automotive repair pictures. This leads right into the first main issue. The 'alt' tag for images usually pertains to the image it is
          displaying. Usually. Some design philosophies use this method to trick search engines into ranking their sites as more relevant.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This malicious behavior, known as SEO poisoning, exploits the trust built into HTML by creating alt tags with popular search terms unrelated to the 
          images themselves. The picture could even be entirely blank.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          So why am I not utilizing this to bolster my website's search result queue? Well, this website doesn't need to pop up in every search result known
          to man. I don't need to get one up on sites by utilizing these cheap tactics because my site has a very specific utility. This is a portfolio website, 
          so if you don't have the URL, you likely don't need to find it. Why would I force my site above other more potentially useful options in the search 
          queue in hopes of being seen by users that have no interest in me as a developer?
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          My alt tags are utilized how they were intended in the language of HTML. It is very important to be able to translate my website throughout many
          different use&ndash;case. My capstone project in university was a presentation about accessibility in design heuristics, and I intend to capitalize on 
          the research I did for that presentation in this project. I am proud to make this website accessible to alternative content browsers such as screen 
          readers for the visually impaired users I may have.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p class="strongest">Do you use desktop, or mobile first design philosophies?</p>
        <section class="philosophy">
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This is a tough question to answer. I find that both approaches have their use cases, depending on the project and target audience. I believe mobile&ndash;
          first layouts are significantly more popular now for good reason. Because of this, I have a strong leaning towards mobile&ndash;first layouts in the work 
          that I do. You may also notice that this site uses a desktop&ndash;first layout alongside responsive designs to accommodate mobile and smaller screens. 
          So why would I dabble in both? Firstly, I need to consider who it is that should be viewing my website. 
          </p>
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In the situations I have given this website URL to, job applications and hiring managers prefer to view my content on a desktop browser instead of mobile
          platforms. Thus, I have adopted a desktop&ndash;first design philosophy while making this website <em>specifically</em>. Some developers may opt for a 
          mobile&ndash;first design regardless of the target user. I find that this call is one to be decided by a project manager when working in a professional 
          environment, and I would defer to their judgement while not working on my personal projects. But for this project, I would argue that it may be beneficial 
          to look at desktop&ndash;centric designs. If my target audiences use mainly desktop platforms, they will not need to render my website in mobile layouts at 
          all. And thus, choosing to opt for a mobile&ndash;design will cost users slightly more render resources to force the conversion from mobile to desktop. By 
          choosing a desktop centric approach, this conversion is not needed, and the accompanying CSS may be discarded by the browser. This may be a small 
          optimization for my end users, but it is an optimization nonetheless. 
          </p>
        </section>
      <p class="strongest">Nice scroll animation on your home page. Why don't you use that more?</p>
        <section class="philosophy">
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In most things, I believe less is more. It's vitally important to not overwhelm users with fancy animations. At the end of the day, graphic design still
          needs to convey information. If your designs aren't aiding the message you are trying to deliver, then why even have them in the first place? I do believe
          in having animations to help my designs come across better to the audience of the modern internet; I think you would be hard pressed to find a website
          today that has any weight behind it without animations at all. I consider these animations to be used sparingly&mdash;and never at the cost of ease of use.</p>
          
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Some animations, like those that used to be featured on popular websites such as Samsung or Apple's homepage, would hijack the user's
          scrolling capability. This would play the animation of their product while keeping the user where they were instead of scrolling them further down the page. 
          Personally, I do not believe in this design for a modern audience. This design can encumber users and inhibit access to other sections of the site. Instead, 
          I use scroll&ndash;based animations sparingly like the one featured in my home page as a way of highlighting content that I believe to be important for those 
          in my target audience.

      </section>
      <section class="halfSpacer"></section>
      <p class="strongest">Why do you declare so many zeros?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          There are a number of different situations where I declare quite a few units. That's just how web design works. The thing is, choosing which units
          to declare and why is the key to maintainable codebases. You may notice through looking into my source code that I have a number of instances where
          I declare a unit to be 0. For example, I use long&ndash;form padding declarations like <span class="code">padding: 0 5rem 0 5rem</span>. It may seem 
          unnecessary to have the extra zeros when a simple <span class="code">padding&ndash;inline: 5rem</span> would work.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I don't actually believe that would be the smartest approach&mdash;especially when it comes to code maintenance. You see, I could easily use the
          proper short form declarations to cut down on the extra typing required. However, when I come back to that element and decide it needs extra styling
          in directions that I haven't yet specified, I end up putting even more time into it while trying to fix that previous mistake. When you're talking about
          money per minute, it's more effective to already declare those placeholders. That way, it's simple to make changes on the fly.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <p class="strongest">Why aren't you using standard <span class="code">ui</span> and <span class="code">ul</span> for your navbars?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This is an interesting one. It all stems from way back in middle school when I first dabbled in HTML and CSS, using <span class="code">ui</span> and 
          <span class="code">ul</span> in order to structure navbars seems to be a tale as old as time itself. With some simple code, you can have a decent
          looking navbar with some html tags, and clever CSS styling. But that's just the thing&mdash;decent. In developmental design, pros and cons are weighed 
          carefully to ensure design goals align with the user experience. In order to greatly hone user experience over traditional designs, I have found that
          flexbox may be used to give better control over navbar elements while maintaining the functionality of lists.</p>

          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Crucially, this does not meaningfully impede accessibility according to my research into the 
          topic. Screen readers and accessibility devices are able to maintain relation&ndash;based operations by recognizing children and sibling elements within
          a container. Furthermore, appropriate class names in CSS are used on top of that to strengthen the association of typical navbars to this flexbox design.
          All in all, I am getting more finely tuned designs while maintaining the same ease of use that accessibility&ndash;dependent users will expect from website 
          development.

      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I can confidently say that learning is the most important part of software development. It is vital to success that a wide range of disciplines make it
          into my software development heuristics. For this reason, it is equally important that the information I am gathering comes from a variety of sources and
          perspectives that showcase strengths to suit my desired goals in creating that piece of software. This website is the culmination of multiple avenues of
          informational exchange by way of professional discussions, casual YouTube videos, talks with those close to me, and online opinions regarding accessibility
          from those who face those challenges. 
        </p>

        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This website is the result of multiple avenues of information exchange, including professional discussions, casual YouTube videos, conversations with people

        <h4 class="insightTitle muted">Diversity</h4>
      </section>
      <section class="halfSpacer"></section>
      <p class="strongest">Do you feel diversity is important for software development?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I strongly believe that diversity leads to success. It's impossible to achieve long&ndash;term success without embracing new and unique perspectives in your work. 
          As a result, I make a conscious effort to include diverse perspectives and inputs in the designs I create. Even though I'm the sole developer of this website, 
          my experiences and opinions are not the only ones that matter for this project. Addressing challenges like design accessibility, user experience simplicity, 
          and appealing aesthetics requires considering more than just my own perspective.
        </p>
        
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Incorporating diversity into design also means being aware of the different ways users will interact with a website. A design that works for one group may 
          not be as intuitive or accessible for others, which is why it's essential to seek out varied feedback, especially from people with different abilities, 
          backgrounds, and preferences. By broadening the scope of feedback and actively engaging with diverse user experiences, I ensure that my designs remain inclusive 
          and adaptable. This approach helps me avoid tunnel vision in development and promotes the creation of solutions that are not just functional but also empathetic 
          to a wider audience. Ultimately, inclusive design fosters a more welcoming and engaging user experience for all.
