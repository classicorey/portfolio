      <p class="strongest">Why are you not using optimization for img alt tags?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When I was researching best practices while developing this website, I came across a relatively disturbing discipline. In order to give you a proper
        reason as to why I don't utilize it, let me tell you about why it exists. When you utilize a search engine to navigate to a website, the engine gathers
        a number of key points of data in order to put each result in a list depending on how likely it is that you are trying to go there. After all, if a 
        search engine doesn't take you where you want to go, what is the point in the first place?</p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Well, some of the data that can be used by certain search engines include metadata for images used in websites. It's relatively clever engineering, 
          to be honest. If a user is trying to search for pet care, a site full of puppy pictures is far more likely to have the information they need than
          one full of automotive repair pictures. This leads right into the first main issue. The 'alt' tag for images usually pertains to the image it is
          displaying. Usually. There are a few design philosophies out there that utilize that same method I detailed in order to trick the search engine as to
          site relevance.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This malicious behaviour, associated with SEO poisoning, utilizes the oversight of trust within the HTML language by creating alt tags on images
          that have nothing to do with the images themselves; and instead house popular search terms regardless of image content. The picture could even be 
          entirely blank.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          So why am I not utilizing this to bolster my website's search result queue? Well, this website doesn't need to pop up in every search result known
          to man. I don't need to get one up on sites by utilizing these cheap tactics because my site has a very specific utility. This is a portfolio website,
          so If you don't have the URL for it, you probably don't need to see it. Why would I force my site above other more potentially useful options in the 
          search queue in hopes of being seen by users that have no interest in me as a developer?
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          My alt tags are utilized how they were intended in the language of HTML. It is very important to be able to translate my website throughout many
          different use&ndash;case. My capstone project in university was a presentation about accessibility in design heuristics, and I intend to capitalize on the research
          I did for that presentation in this project. I am proud to make this website accessible to alternative content browsers such as screen readers for
          the visually impaired users I may have.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p class="strongest">Do you use desktop, or mobile first design philosophies?</p>
        <section class="philosophy">
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This is a tough question to answer. I find that each have its use&ndash;case depending on the project at hand as well as the intended audience. I
          believe mobile&ndash;first layouts are significantly more popular now for good reason. Because of this, I have a strong leaning towards mobile&ndash;first
          layouts in the work that I do. You may also find, however, that this site uses a desktop&ndash;first layout in addition to responsive layouts to accommodate
          mobile and small screen patterns. So why would I dabble in both? Firstly, I need to consider who it is that should be viewing my website. 
          </p>
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In the situations I have given this website URL to, job applications and hiring managers prefer to view my content on a desktop browser instead of mobile
          platforms. Thus, I have adopted a desktop&ndash;first design philosophy while making this website <em>specifically</em>. Some developers may have opted
          to go for a mobile&ndash;first design platform regardless of the end user. I find that this call is one to be decided by a project manager when working
          in a professional environment, and I would defer to their judgement while not working on my personal projects. But for this project, I would argue that
          it may be beneficial to look at desktop&ndash;centric designs. If my target audiences use mainly desktop platforms, they will not need to render my website
          in mobile layouts at all. And thus, choosing to opt for a mobile&ndash;design will cost users slightly more render resources to force the conversion from
          mobile to desktop. By choosing a desktop centric approach, this conversion is not needed, and the accompanying CSS may be discarded by the browser. This
          may be a small optimization for my end users, but it is an optimization nonetheless. 
          </p>

      <p class="strongest">Nice scroll animation on your home page. Why don't you use that more?</p>
        <section class="philosophy">
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In most things, I believe less is more. It's vitally important to not overwhelm users with fancy animations. At the end of the day, graphic design still
          needs to convey information. If your designs aren't aiding the message you are trying to deliver, then why even have them in the first place? I do believe
          in having animations to help my designs come across better to the audience of the modern internet&mdash;I think you would be hard pressed to find a website
          today that has any weight behind it without animations at all. I consider these animations to be used sparingly&mdash;and never at the cost of ease of use.</p>
          
          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Some animations, like those that used to be featured on popular websites such as Samsung or Apple's homepage, would hijack the user's
          scrolling capability. This would play the animation of their product while keeping the user where they were instead of scrolling them further down the page. Personally,
          I do not believe in this design for a modern audience. This design may serve to only encumber the end user, and inhibit their access to further sections of the
          website. Instead, I use scroll&ndash;based animations sparingly like the one featured in my home page as a way of highlighting content that I believe to be
          important for those in my target audience.

      <p class="strongest">Why do you declare so many zeros?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          There are a number of different situations where I declare quite a few units. That's just how web design works. The thing is, choosing which units
          to declare and why is the key to maintainable codebases. You may notice through looking into my source code that I have a number of instances where
          I declare a unit to be 0. For example, I utilize longform padding declarations such as <span class="code">padding: 0 5rem 0 5rem;</span>
          it may seem relatively silly to have the two extra 0's when a simple <span class="code">padding&ndash;inline: 5rem;</span> would suffice.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I don't actually believe that would be the smartest approach&mdash;especially when it comes to code maintenance. You see, I could easily use the
          proper short form declarations to cut down on the extra typing required. However, when I come back to that element and decide it needs extra styling
          in directions that I haven't yet specified, I end up putting even more time into it while trying to fix that previous mistake. When you're talking about
          money per minute, it's more effective to already declare those placeholders. That way, it's simple to make changes on the fly.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <p class="strongest">Why aren't you using standard <span class="code">ui</span> and <span class="code">ul</span> for your navbars?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This is an interesting one. It all stems from way back in middle school when I first dabbled in HTML and CSS. using <span class="code">ui</span> and 
          <span class="code">ul</span> in order to structure navbars seems to be a tale as old as time itself. With some simple code, you can have a decent
          looking navbar with some html tags, and clever CSS styling. But that's just the thing&mdash;decent. In developmental design, pros and cons are utilized
          heavily to ensure that design visions align with user&ndash;experience. In order to greatly hone user experience over traditional designs, I have found that
          flexbox may be used to give better control over navbar elements while maintaining the functionality of lists.</p>

          <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Crucially, this does not meaningfully impede accessibility according to my research into the 
          topic. Screen readers and accessibility devices are able to maintain relation&ndash;based operations by recognizing children and sibling elements within
          a container. Furthermore, appropriate class names in CSS are used on top of that to strengthen the association of typical navbars to this flexbox design.
          All in all, I am getting more fine design tuning while maintaining the same ease of use that accessibility&ndash;dependent users will expect from website development.
