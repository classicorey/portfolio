      <p class="strongest">Why are you not using optimization for img alt tags?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When I was researching best practices while developing this website, I came across a relatively disturbing discipline. In order to give you a proper
        reason as to why I don't utilize it, let me tell you about why it exists. When you utilize a search engine to navigate to a website, the engine gathers
        a number of key points of data in order to put each result in a list depending on how likely it is that you are trying to go there. After all, if a 
        search engine doesn't take you where you want to go, what is the point in the first place?</p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Well, some of the data that can be used by certain search engines include metadata for images used in websites. It's relatively clever engineering, 
          to be honest. If a user is trying to search for pet care, a site full of puppy pictures is far more likely to have the information they need than
          one full of automotive repair pictures. This leads right into the first main issue. The 'alt' tag for images usually pertains to the image it is
          displaying. Usually. There are a few design philosophies out there that utilize that same method I detailed in order to trick the search engine as to
          site relevance.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This malicious behaviour, associated with SEO poisoning, utilizes the oversight of trust within the HTML language by creating alt tags on images
          that have nothing to do with the images themselves; and instead house popular search terms regardless of image content. The picture could even be 
          entirely blank.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          So why am I not utilizing this to bolster my website's search result queue? To put it quite frankly, I have a basic level of respect for my peer
          developers. I don't need to get one up on sites by utilizing these cheap tactics because my site has a very specific utility. If you don't have the
          URL for it, you probably don't need to see it. Why would I force my site above other more potentially useful options in the hopes of being seen by
          users?
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          My alt tags are utilized how they were intended in the language of HTML. It is very important to be able to translate my website throughout many
          different use&#45;case. My capstone project in university was a presentation about accessibility in design heuristics, and I intend to capitalize on the research
          I did for that presentation in this project. I am proud to make this website accessible to alternative content browsers such as screen readers for
          the visually impaired users I may have.

      <h4 class="insightTitle muted">Design Implementations</h4>
      <p class="strongest">Why do you declare so many zeros?</p>
      <section class="philosophy">
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          There are a number of different situations where I declare quite a few units. That's just how web design works. The thing is, choosing which units
          to declare and why is the key to maintainable codebases. You may notice through looking into my source code that I have a number of instances where
          I declare a unit to be 0. For example, I utilize longform padding delcarations such as <span class="code">padding: 0 5rem 0 5rem;</span>
          it may seem relatively silly to have the two extra 0's when a simple <span class="code">padding-inline: 5rem;</span> would suffice.
        </p>
        <p class="multiParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I don't actually believe that would be the smartest approach&#8212;especially when it comes to code maintenance. You see, I could easily use the
          proper short form declarations to cut down on the extra typing required. However, when I come back to that element and decide it needs extra styling
          in directions that I haven't yet specified, I end up putting even more time into it while trying to fix that previous mistake. When you're talking about
          money per minute, it's more effective to already declare those placeholders. That way, it's simple to make changes on the fly.

      <p class="strongest">Why aren't you using standard <span class="code">ui</span> and <span class="code">ul</span> for your navbars?</p>

          This is an interesting one. It all stems from way back in middle school when I first dabbled in HTML and CSS.
